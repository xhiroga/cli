# r2z
replace .rar to .zip recursively.
! Work on macOS. I do not no how this works on others.

# At first
1. install [unrar](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/5169-winrar-for-mac.html)
(Thank to Alexander Roshal)

2. put `r2z` to your PATH.

# How to use
`r2z YOUR_TARGET_DIRECTORY_OR_RAR_FILE > r2z.log`
